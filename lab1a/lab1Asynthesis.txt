1) Steps:
First we set the pointers to be seperated by one block of memory
  - This was important b/c the pointers were off by the size of the data type (e.g int -> 4 bytes)

Second the pointers data type are casted into char
  -  Chars are one byte long therefore the pointer arithmetic is scaled by one. Letting us measure
     bytes between addresses in units of one

Lastly we returned the subtraction of the two pointers, giving us the size of the data type.
  - Subtracting two pointers gives how many memory addresses are between them scaled by the size of the
    data type of the pointer (pointer arithmetic). So by casting the pointers to be char pointers, this
    subtraction will return the size of the data type.
-----------------------------------------------------------
2) Explain:
The parameters (integers instead of pointers) would be passed as copies so swapping them doesn't 
change the values at the original memory locations (like passing ints into a method in Java).

3) Positive and Drawback:

Positive: A benefit of learning about refrecence in Java was it mimicted the "concept of a pointer".
          Therefore learning fundementally how pointers work and their specifics wasn't too much of
          a learning curve.

Drawback: Coming out the intro series, we are not familiar with what pointers actually are , so 
it was a little hard to wrap our heads around it when it was being introduced in this class. When you go 
onto websites such as StackOverflow, seeing people talking about pointers is jarring and confusing.
